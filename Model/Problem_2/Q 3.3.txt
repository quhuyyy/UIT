[Q 3.3] Symmetric Matrix
Given a two-dimensional array whose each element is integer, its size is N x N.
Implement the following function:
bool isSymmetric(int arr[][1000], int row, int col);
Where arr, row and col are the given two-dimensional array, its number of rows and its number of columns. A matrix is called as symmetric matrix if for all i, j; the value of the element on row i, column j is equal to the value of the element on row j, column i. Check whether the given array is symmetric matrix or not; return true if it is, otherwise return false.
Note: Libraries iostream and string have been imported, and namespace std has been used.
