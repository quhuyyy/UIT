[Q 3.8] Odd Sub Matrixes
Given a two-dimensional array whose each element is integer, its size is M x N.
Implement the following function:
int subMatrix(int arr[][1000], int row, int col);
Where arr, row and col are the given two-dimensional array, its number of rows and its number of columns. A sub-array whose size is 2x2 is called as HN4 if the sum of all elements of it is an odd number. Find the number of sub-array of the given array.
Note: Libraries iostream, vector, and string have been imported, and namespace std has been used.
