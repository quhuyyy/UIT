[Q 3.7] Diagonals Difference
Given a two-dimensional array whose each element is an integer, its size is M x N.
Implement the following function:
int diagonalDiff(int arr[][1000], int row, int col, int x, int y);
Where arr, row and col are the given two-dimensional array, its number of rows and its number of columns. ; x and y represent the cell whose index of the row is x and index of the column is y (0≤x<row và 0≤y<col). The sum of a diagonal is the sum of all elements on it. Find the absolute value of the difference between the sums of two diagonal containing the cell which is represented by x and y of the given array.
Note: Libraries iostream, vector, and string have been imported, and namespace std has been used.
